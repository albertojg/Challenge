##Description

This project demonstrates the use of the Autocomplete feature Google Places API to enter a location and displays the results on a Google Map. Autocomplete is a feature of the Places library in the Google Maps JavaScript API. You can use autocomplete to give your applications the type-ahead-search behavior of the Google Maps search field. When a user starts typing an address, autocomplete will fill in the rest.

Auto-suggestions are displayed in a dropdown list and the user can select the desired location from this list.
